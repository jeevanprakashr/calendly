## Architecture of the application
The basic objective of this application is to enable an individual user to book an available free slot of another user. Its basically an appointment booking system. To implement this feature, I used patient-doctor appointment booking scenario.
Both patient and doctor has to be registered with their respective mail id and the details will be stored in the relational database.
Once a patient logined, he can book an appointment with the docter he desires and the appointments he made is viewed in the dashboard. Once the appointments are made, the respective doctor can view the appointments of the day in his dashboard.
